This folder contains information about using URB on Z-scale layouts

To make URB compatible with Z-scale add a single diode between the 12 volt
accessory output of the MÃ¤rklin Z-scale controller and the input of the 
L298Ns 12V input. Use the accessory ground output of the controller as
common ground for all equipment, both railroad accessories and electronic
components of the Universal Railway Bus
